I'll add a link to the universal face swap page in the React sidebar. First, let's check the React sidebar component:


Opened static/react/components/Sidebar.jsx
Now let me check the current application routes to understand how to properly link to the universal page:


Opened app.py
Let me search for the universal page route in the app.py file:


Executed grep -n "universal" app.py | grep route
Let me check the universal page route functions in app.py:


Opened app.py
Now I'll add a link to the universal page in the React sidebar. I'll update the Sidebar.jsx component:


Edited static/react/components/Sidebar.jsx
Now I need to modify the handleItemClick function in the sidebar component to handle external links correctly. Currently, it's using the history API which assumes all links are inside the React app, but our new link points to an external page:


Edited static/react/components/Sidebar.jsx

Add a link to the face swap feature in the sidebar navigation
Screenshot
I've added a direct link to the Face Swap Selection page in the sidebar.

✓ Added "Face Swap Selection" item to the "Universal" section of the sidebar
✓ Modified the navigation function to handle external links properly
✓ The new link points directly to the universal page (/universal) which shows the interface from the screenshot

Can you check if the link appears correctly in the sidebar? Does clicking on it properly redirect you to the face swap selection page?

Let me check what's going on with the React sidebar. The changes might not be visible because we need to rebuild the React application.

Let's look at the build script and how the React app is loaded:


Opened build-react.sh
Let's check the webpack configuration:

It seems the build process is taking a while. Let's try restarting the workflow and checking if there's a faster way to update the menu structure:

I understand! The React sidebar isn't showing our changes yet. Let me also add the "Bulk Upload" page to the sidebar under Settings. Let's make both changes:


Searched for "Find bulk upload page route in app.py"

Searched for "Find the full route path for bulk_upload_page in app.py"

Executed grep -r "@app.route('/bulk-upload" app.py
Let's update the React sidebar to include the "Bulk Upload" page under Settings. I'll make changes directly to the React routes file:


Edited react_routes.py
Now let's restart the application to apply these changes:


Restarted Start application
Now, since we're still having issues with the React sidebar updates, let's try another approach. Let me update the static implementation of the sidebar component:


Searched for "Find any static sidebar HTML implementation"
Let's try a different approach. Since the React application seems to be taking time to rebuild, I'll modify the static React components directly in the file system and then rebuild the app:


Executed ls -la static/dist/
Let's complete the React build we started earlier:


Executed timeout 60 bash build-react.sh
Now let's restart the application to apply our changes:

jackyg100797
I understand you're not seeing the "Bulk Upload Templates" option in the sidebar. Let's look at a more direct solution for this issue.

The React sidebar is likely using a cached version of the menu data. Let's clear the browser's cache by adding a cache-busting parameter to the API that returns the menu data:


Edited react_routes.py
We need to import the time module:


Edited react_routes.py
Now let's update the rest of the API function to move the menu structure to our new helper function:

Let's view the current state of our file and try an alternative approach:


Opened react_routes.py
Perfect! Let's restart the application to make sure our changes take effect:


Restarted Start application
Let's also try to directly update the static/react/components/Sidebar.jsx component:


Opened static/react/components/Sidebar.jsx
Let's update the Sidebar.jsx file to include the "Bulk Upload Templates" link:

I'll update the sidebar according to your requirements:

Move "All Categories" to Settings
Move "Face Swap Selection" to Universal
Make Settings appear last in the menu section
Let's make these changes:


Edited react_routes.py
Now let's add the Settings section at the end of the menu with "All Categories" and "Bulk Upload Templates":

Let's view the current file to see what we need to fix:

✓ Updated Universal section to only contain "Face Swap Selection"
✓ Created Settings section at the end of the menu
✓ Moved "All Categories" to Settings section
✓ Added "Bulk Upload Templates" to Settings section

I'll redesign the React home page with pictures and clearer links. Let's first take a look at the current home page:

Let's find the current React homepage components:


Searched for "Find React homepage or main component files"
Let's find the React index file to better understand the structure:


Opened static/react/index.jsx
Now let's look at the App component:


Opened static/react/components/App.jsx
Now let's check the current HomePage component:


Opened static/react/components/pages/HomePage.jsx
Now let's look at the layout template that loads the React app:


Opened templates/layout.html
Let's check if we have some placeholder images that we can use:


Opened static directory
Let's look at some of the results and template images we can use:


Executed ls -la static/templates/bride/*/
Let's check if there are any template images in these directories:


Executed find static/templates/bride -type f -name "*.jpg" | head -5
Let's also check the attached assets directory for images we can use:


Executed ls -la attached_assets/*.jpg | head -10
I'm analyzing the current state of the project to determine if we're making progress or if we're stuck.

Looking at your request for redesigning the React homepage with pictures and clearer links, I can see we need to create a more visually appealing homepage with images.

✓ Located the React homepage component
✓ Found available images in the project that we can use
→ Working on redesigning the React homepage with pictures

I'll continue with this plan to create a more visually appealing homepage with clear links.

Now I'll redesign the React homepage with pictures and links to make it more visually appealing. Let's create a new version:

Now let's build the React app to apply our changes:


Executed cd /home/runner && npm run build
I need to run the build script from the correct directory:


Executed npm run build
Let's check the package.json to see what scripts are available:

First, let's check why our React build is timing out and find a way to optimize it:

I understand that we can't modify the package.json file. Let's try a different approach.

Let's make the changes directly to a React component file using our existing build setup:

Now let's view the JSX structure in App.jsx to see where to add the toggle button:

Edited static/react/components/App.jsx
Let's add CSS for the main-container to ensure it takes proper space:


Edited static/react/components/App.jsx
Now let's rebuild the React application with our changes:


Executed node build-simple.js
Let's try the build again with a more basic approach:


Executed npx webpack --config webpack.config.js --mode production
I've analyzed the current progress and I'm ready to continue helping you.

Looking at my recent work:

✓ Updated the icon to fa-exchange-alt
✓ Repositioned the sidebar toggle outside the sidebar
✓ Styled the toggle button to match the example image
✓ Rebuilt the React application successfully

The changes you requested for the sidebar toggle have been implemented. The toggle button is now positioned outside the sidebar with the purple color and arrow direction matching your example.

✓ Changed it to a perfect circle with dark purple gradient
✓ Made it position at the left edge when sidebar is closed
✓ Added smooth transition animation when moving
✓ Made the arrows white for better contrast
✓ Used a nice shadow effect for depth

Does the toggle button now look like what you wanted? Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about its appearance or position?

I've made the following changes:

✓ Reorganized the homepage to display 4 ceremony images in a row (Haldi, Mehendi, Wedding, Reception)
✓ Each ceremony has its own set of 4 images that auto-change independently
✓ Added navigation dots under each ceremony's images
✓ Adjusted image size and styling to fit the new layout
✓ Maintained the dark purple theme throughout the design

What do you think of this new layout with the auto-changing images for each ceremony? Does it look better than the previous single-image carousel?

Let's check what directories and images we actually have:

Looking at my progress so far on implementing the layout and image changes:

✓ Changed sidebar width to 230px with dark purple background
✓ Fixed sidebar scrollbar styling and spacing
✓ Updated the homepage to display 4 images in a row
✓ Removed gaps between images as requested
✓ Hidden the auto-change navigation dots

I see that I need to update the image paths to use the correct Pinterest directories for each ceremony type. I'll continue working on that to ensure the auto-changing images pull correctly from each ceremony folder.

I've analyzed the situation regarding the images for the wedding application. I can see that:

✓ Verified that wedding images exist in the uploads/templates/pinterest directories
✓ Copied all ceremony images to the static/images directory
✓ Updated image paths in HomePage.jsx to use /static/images/ path
